Stateless Ownership of Digital Goods

When a customer makes a purchase, do not store data on the server, rather give the customer a unique tamperproof Download Certificate for downloading and re-downloading the purchased product.

The first and foremost is customer email and name as verified by a payment processor, without that information the certificate will not be unpacked.

Fronting customer email and name will discourage the customer from sharing the digital download certificate.

Certificate may be re-issued upon a re-download, meaning that an older certificate may be invalidated by passage of time.
